#' Create day of week correction priors
#'
#' @description This function proposes prior distributions for the weights of
#'  day-of-week effect. Weekly periodicity is often observed in the case
#'  timeseries, and is likely typically caused by some genuine weekly cyclical
#'  pattern of infections (due to changes in contact pattern), and some changes
#'  in test seeking behaviour resulting in more test seeking on some days of
#'  the week. The latter is likely the dominant effect, so this function
#'  proposes DOW periodicity as an effect within the observation model, and
#'  constructs DOW weights such that infections on different days of the week
#'  would have longer or shorter than usual observation delay, thus producing a
#'  DOW oscillation in the convolved observation timeseries. The DOW weight
#'  prior is proposed as a 7-variate Dirichlet distribution, but alternative
#'  proposals may be implemented in the future.
