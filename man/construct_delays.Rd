\usage{
construct_delays(
  ecdf_1,
  ecdf_2 = NULL,
  delay_range = c(-3, 28),
  output = c("probability", "cumulative density"),
  stepfun_output = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{ecdf_1}{empirical cdf}

\item{ecdf_2}{optional second empirical cdf to combine}

\item{delay_range}{number of days to create distribution for}

\item{output}{output style, choice of "probability" or "cumulative density"}

\item{stepfun_output}{logical whether or not to output as step function}
}
\value{
delay distribution in range of forms
}
\description{
Given a date range to compute delays over, and an empirical cdf,
compute the probability of delay having that length. Outputs either the
probability or the cumulative density, as either a data frame lined up
against days-of-day or as a step function in the style of R native ecdf
function. Optionally, two cdfs can be used as input, in which case the
probability and cdf of the additive combined delay are calculated.
